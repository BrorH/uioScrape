## FAQ
### *Why does the program ask me to log in with my UiO account?*
As a UiO student you are granted access to the course pages of most semester pages of most subjects. Simply telling the UiO servers that you are indeed a student grants you the ability to view and download resources that do not appear publicly on the semester web pages.

### *Ummm, ok is there a "no-login" option?*
Yes! While not currently fully implemented, there will soon be an option to perform classic web-scraping of the html pages of each semester course. While this scraping allows _anyone_ to scrape for pdfs this method is slow, resource heavy, has **very** ugly code and most importantly *it **can't** find* the above mentioned non-public files (which are often the most juicy ones üòâ)

### *Can I get in trouble for using this?*
No. However, common sense applies; dont behave inappropriately or be an idiot and everything will be fine. These files are available to all UiO students, this program just quickly and neatly collects them.

### *When will you eat üçï*?
The day when I wont have to google regex syntaxing, I'll allow myself a slice
